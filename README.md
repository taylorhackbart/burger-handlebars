# KRUSTY CRAB

## DESRCIPTION
For this assignment, we created a website that will allow the user to add/order a burger that they would like to eat. Once the burger has been added, they can click the "devour" button, and it will be shown on the right side of the screen as devoured.

## Usage
When you open this website it will look like:
<img src="https://github.com/taylorhackbart/burger-handlebars/blob/master/readmeimgs/full.png">

All of the burgers that have been added but not eaten will be on the left:
<img src="https://github.com/taylorhackbart/burger-handlebars/blob/master/readmeimgs/toeat.png">

And once the burger has been devoured, it will appear on the right and the button will disappear, because nobody wants to eat a regurgitated burger:

To add a burger, type in the name of the burger you would like to add, and click "add krabby patty":

This new burger will appear on the right side of the screen, waiting to be eaten:
